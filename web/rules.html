                <h3>How to play</h3>
                <p>
                    Each player begins the game with two roles which are secret from the other players; these are your influences. Through various actions, players can be forced to reveal an influence. When both of a player's influences are revealed they are knocked out of the game. The last player with one or more unrevealed influences wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are five different roles: embaixador, assassino, capit達o, condessa and duque. Each player's influences are drawn from a pool of 15, containing three of each of the five roles. Each player also starts with $2, drawn from an unlimited central store of money.
                </p>
                <h4>Actions</h4>
                <p>
                    At the start of their turn, a player performs one of several actions. Some actions can always be played, while others require a specific role:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Draw $1 of renda.</li>
                        <li>Draw $2 of ajuda externa; any player with the duque can block this action.</li>
                        <li>Pay $7 to stage a golpe, forcing a player of your choice to reveal one influence; this action cannot be blocked.</li>
                        <li>The embaixador can draw two new roles and choose to trocar any of them with their remaining hidden influences.</li>
                        <li>The assassino can pay $3 to make a player of their choice reveal an influence. If the targeted player has the condessa, they can block the assassinoation.</li>
                        <li>The capit達o can extorquir $2 from another player. If the targeted player has the embaixador or the capit達o, they can block the action.</li>
                        <li>The duque can claim taxa, gaining $3.</li>
                    </ul>
                    After playing an action, the other players have an opportunity to block the action or to challenge it. After this, the turn passes to the next player.
                </p>
                <h4>Challenging</h4>
                <p>
                     Since your roles are hidden, no one but you knows whether or not you have the necessary role to play the action you chose. This means that you can play any of the above actions on your turn, regardless of what roles you actually have. However, if another player suspects that you do not have the role you claim, they may challenge you. If you are challenged, you must show the role that you claimed. If you do so, the challenger must reveal one of their influences as a penalty for challenging you incorrectly. They can no longer use this influence for the remainder of the game. The role you showed is shuffled back into the deck, and you draw a new card to replace it. After such a failed challenge, your original action is completed as usual.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    On the other hand, if the challenger is right and you do not have the role that you claimed, you must instead reveal one of your own influences, which you can no longer use for the remainder of the game. If successfully challenged in this way, your original action is not carried out. Note that there are three basic actions which do not require a specific role and can never be challenged: renda, ajuda externa and golpe.
                </p>
                <h4>Blocking</h4>
                <p>
                    If your action is not challenged, a player may instead choose to block your action with one of their own roles, as described in the list above. If anyone suspects that the blocking player does not have the role they need in order to block the action, the blocking player can be challenged too, in the same way as above, with the same consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that there are two ways to lose both your influences in the same turn. Firstly, by incorrectly challenging an assassinoation: you lose one influence for the failed challenge, and another by being assassinard. Secondly, when a player tries to assassinar you, and you falsely claim to have a condessa in order to block the assassinoation: if challenged, you lose one influence for the successful challenge against you, and another by being assassinard.
                </p>
                <h4>inquisidores</h4>
                <p>
                    golpe reforma introduces a new role, the inquisidor, who can choose one of the following actions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Draw one new role from the deck and choose to trocar it with either of their remaining hidden influences.</li>
                        <li>Choose an opponent and look at one of their influences (picked at random). The inquisidor then has the option to force the opponent to swap that role for another drawn from the deck.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The inquisidor is used instead of the embaixador, and as such can also block a capit達o from extorquiring.
                </p>
                <h4>reforma</h4>
                <p>
                    golpe reforma is an expansion that adds teams to the base game. Each player starts off as a loyalist or a reformist. Players cannot do the following actions on other players who are on the same team:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stage a golpe</li>
                        <li>assassinar</li>
                        <li>extorquir</li>
                        <li>interrogar</li>
                        <li>Block ajuda externa</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note that you <b>can</b> challenge other players on your team. There are some additional actions that everyone can use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pay $1 to change to the other team.</li>
                        <li>Pay $2 to converter another player to the other team.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The money for these actions goes into a pot called the treasury reserve.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any player who is not the duque can take all money from the treasury reserve (desviar).</li>
                    </ul>
                    When a player attempts to desviar and you suspect that they have the duque role, you can challenge them. If the player has the duque role, they must forfeit an influence and return the money. Note that this is different to a normal challenge: they player must <b>not</b> have the duque role in order to desviar.
                <p>
                <p>
                    If it happens that all players are on the same team, then everyone can attack whoever they want. The game only ends when one player is left alive.
